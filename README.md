// TEST PLAN //
---------------
Properties of MyShell:
- can take up to one input (batch mode), can also take none (interactive mode)

Batch Mode
- mysh will open the file and display its contents as commands in specified format. Mysh will then execute the commands
- mysh terminates after all contents are read or the exit command is read

Interactive Mode
- mysh will prompt the user to input commands to traverse through directories/files

Plan to check code for said properties:
- use a DIR* 

Methods:
